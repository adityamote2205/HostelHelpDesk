## Website Overview & Features

- **Student's Portal for Grievance resolution** :
    The student portal enables registered users to submit grievances concerning hostel and mess facilities, ensuring privacy by restricting hostel grievances to 
    respective block rectors and allowing all rectors to view mess grievances. Students can update their profiles, track grievance status including pending, 
    completed, and total, and add descriptions and images as proof for each grievance. The system facilitates efficient grievance management by authorities, offers 
    deletion options for students before completion, and ensures security, privacy, accessibility, and usability throughout the platform.

- **Rector's Dasboard** :
   The rector's dashboard facilitates signup/login for rectors, granting access to view grievances submitted by students within their block for hostel issues and all mess grievances, including photos submitted by 
   students as proof. Rectors can discern details such as submission date, room number, and student identity for each grievance. Upon resolving a grievance, rectors can mark it as completed, reflecting the status 
   change on the student's account. Additionally, rectors can filter grievances by type for efficient management. The dashboard includes a profile section where rectors can monitor their workload, such as the 
   number of complaints received, pending, and completed, and update their profile information as necessary.

- **Reflection of completion of grievance on student's account** :
   After review and resolution by the rector, when a grievance is marked as completed, the status is automatically updated on the student's account, indicating the date and time of completion. This seamless 
   process ensures that students are promptly informed about the resolution of their grievances.
